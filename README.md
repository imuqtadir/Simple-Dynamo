# Simple-Dynamo
The main goal of this project is implementing a simplified version of Dynamo. There are three main pieces that are included: 1) Partitioning, 2) Replication, and 3) Failure handling.  The main goal is to provide both availability and linearizability at the same time. In other words, the implementation always perform read and write operations successfully even under failures. At the same time, a read operation should always return the most recent value. Project provides you both availability and linearizability at the same time. The exception is partitioning and replication, which should be done exactly the way Dynamo does.
